# 🏬 Walmart Sales Dashboard
**📝 Problem Statement**
The goal of this project is to analyze Walmart's sales data to uncover patterns in profitability and sales performance. By examining the data across multiple years, product categories, and monthly trends, the analysis aims to drive informed business decisions, optimize sales strategies, and identify areas of operational improvement.

**🚀 Project Overview**
This project comprehensively analyzes Walmart’s sales data using Power BI and Figma. The dashboard provides a clear visual understanding of key business metrics including yearly profit trends, product category performance, and month-wise sales distribution. These insights are designed to empower stakeholders with data-driven strategies to improve revenue and customer satisfaction.

Figma was used for the initial dashboard interface mock-up to enhance visual design and usability, ensuring a clean, intuitive layout. Complex aggregations and business logic were handled using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) within Power BI.

**🛠 Tools & Technologies Used**
